NOTE: This project was completed as part of Harvard's CS50 on EdX.

For this project I implemented this following functions:
1- index: shows the main page.
2- buy: buys stocks by its symbol.
3- history: shows the history of your bought or sold stocks and also your added cash.
4- addCash: it adds cash into your account.
5- password: that makes you change your password.
6- register: registering for new account.
7- sell: sell stocks you have bought.

I also changed the lookup function in helpers.py to make it return the real company name not only its symbol.

All code other than that was provided from CS50.
