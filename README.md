NOTE: This project was completed as part of Harvard's CS50 on EdX.

For this project I implemented this following functions:<br> <br>
1- **index**: shows the main page. <br>
2- **buy**: buys stocks by its symbol. <br>
3- **history**: shows the history of your bought or sold stocks and also your added cash. <br>
4- **addCash**: it adds cash into your account. <br>
5- **password**: that makes you change your password.<br>
6- **register**: registering for new account.<br>
7- **sell**: sell stocks you have bought.<br>

I also changed the **lookup** function in helpers.py to make it return the real company name not only its symbol.

All code other than that was provided from CS50.
